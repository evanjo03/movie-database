# Movie Database
Personal Project
 
## Movie Database
Created after exposure to AJAX calls, this application was a personal project for a friend. After supplying a list of movies, the application creates a dynamic list the movies for viewing, making use of the OMDB API.  There are various genre-sorting buttons to filter through the list.  Selecting a movie will pull up a page with more in-depth information about that particular movie.
